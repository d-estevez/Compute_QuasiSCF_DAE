# Compute_QuasiSCF_DAE:

The program from Generate_QuasiSCF_Steps computes a QuasiSCF via a PreSCF for 
regular linear time varying DAEs and provides the 
projector $\Pi_{can}$ accordingly to:

   "Computing standard canonical forms of regular linear
   time varying DAEs via a preliminary stage", Preprint 2025,
   https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08921

The program was tested using: numpy version: 1.26.4, sympy version: 1.13.2

The program has been conceived for academic purposes and for testing only. It is published here in the hope that it may be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.
