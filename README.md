Compute_QuasiSCF_DAE:

This program computes a QuasiSCF via a PreSCF for 
regular linear time varying DAEs and provides the 
projector Pi_can accordingly to:

Diana Estévez Schwarz, René Lamour, and Roswitha März: 
   "Computing standard canonical forms of regular linear
   time varying DAEs via a preliminary stage"

The programm was tested using: numpy version: 1.26.4, sympy version: 1.13.2
